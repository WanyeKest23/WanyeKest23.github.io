			<h2>Tips for Proper Form</h2>
			<p>To ensure that you're using proper form when lifting weights, follow these tips:</p>
      <br>
			<ul>
				<li>Start with a light weight: If you're new to lifting weights or trying a new exercise, start with a light weight to get the hang of the proper form before gradually increasing the weight.</li>
				<li>Engage your core: To maintain good posture and stability, engage your core muscles throughout the exercise.</li>
				<li>Keep your back straight: Avoid rounding your back, which can put strain on your spine and increase the risk of injury.</li>
				<li>Control your movements: Focus on controlling the weight throughout the exercise, rather than relying on momentum to lift it.</li>
				<li>Use a spotter: If you're lifting heavy weights, it's always a good idea to have a spotter to assist you if needed.</li>
